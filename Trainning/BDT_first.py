                                        #   to separate positive and negative classes. Higher is better (range: 0 to 1).

                                     # - Controls the complexity of the model.
                                     # - Prevents overfitting by limiting tree depth.

                                     # - Determines how much the weights are updated after each boosting step.
                                     # - A smaller eta value (like 0.05) ensures more gradual learning,

                                     # - Penalizes large weights in the model to reduce complexity and prevent overfitting.
                                     # - A value of 1.0 is commonly used as a starting point.
                                     # - Higher values (e.g., 2.0 or more) can be tried if the model overfits.
    'alpha': 0.5,                    # L1 regularization (Lasso regularization):
                                     # - Encourages sparsity in the model, effectively selecting important features by
                                     #   driving some feature weights to zero.
                                     # - Useful when the dataset has many features and may contain redundant ones.

                                     # - A value of 1 is suitable for clean and balanced data.
